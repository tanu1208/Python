Basic Bash programming. 

### Comments
Did not create a method for track so it could be sourced and just written "track start/stop/status/log", did not think of this until I was done. 
The solution I made now is just an executable file with chmod a+x, so it still runs you just have to use "./track start/stop/status/log". 
I have commented some parts of the code for my own sake (and maybe for the grader?), overall it all works, eventhough I might have taken a bit longer route on some parts of the task.
