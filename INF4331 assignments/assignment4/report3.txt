I used same parameters in all three files. You can see that the time difference is almost 3 times as much in mandelbrot_2, compared to mandelbrot_1. But comparing mandelbrot_3 to the other files you can see that this program is almost 92 times faster than mandelbrot_2, and 29 times faster than mandelbrot_1. (The time will increase depending on what the max_iteration is)



Advantages of Numba:
Easy to use, supports numpy operations and objects, fast, highly automated.

Disadvantages of Numba:
Limited support for classes, hard to understand and debug (like magic), Needs to be installed as external dependency.
