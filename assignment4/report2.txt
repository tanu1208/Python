mandelbrot_1: 
	width = 1000;
	height = 1000;
	max_iteration = 80;
	yMin = -1.18;
	yMax = 1.5;
	xMin = -2.18;
	xMax = 0.5;

mandelbrot_2:
	width = 1000;
	height = 1000;
	max_iteration = 80;
	yMin = -1.18;
	yMax = 1.5;
	xMin = -2.18;
	xMax = 0.5;

	runtime: 51.670 sec

I used same parameters on both files, and you can see that the time difference is almost 3 times as much in mandelbrot_2. This is because the added loops and array calulations in the numpy implementation. The time will increase depending on what the max_iteration is.
