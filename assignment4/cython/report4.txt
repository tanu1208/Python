I used same parameters on both files, and you can see that the time difference is not that much greater with cython. It might be because I did not change the code in the pyx file to proper cython format. I just ran it as cython and executed the file. This is done with the mandelbrot_4_test.py. I tried to convert the code to cython, but it gave me some error messages which I did not understand. That is why I left it and just ran it with the cython compiler. It is still a bit faster, but It will probably be faster on larger values.
